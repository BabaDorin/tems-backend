TEMS is going to be a free & open-source IT Service Management solution.

The goal of this project is to offer a lightweight and easy-to-use application for inventory & ticket management (such as Service Now). If you are willing to contribute, let me know (bvd.dorin@gmail.com), I would highly appreciate that!

Tech stack (as for now):

ASP.Net Minimal APIs
.NET 6
Entity Framework
xUnit
